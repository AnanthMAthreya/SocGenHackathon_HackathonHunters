# 🔐 Threat Feed Collector – SocGen Hackathon

This is the **Feed Collector module** for an AI-powered Threat Intelligence Feed Aggregator. It is responsible for fetching, cleaning, and organizing cyber threat intelligence from various open-source RSS/Atom feeds.

## 📌 What It Does

- ✅ Collects cyber threat feeds from 45+ sources
- ✅ Cleans and normalizes titles, links, summaries, and publish dates
- ✅ Removes duplicate entries based on links
- ✅ Stores cleaned data in both JSON and CSV formats for downstream processing

## 📁 Project Structure

```
ThreatFeedCollector/
├── feeds.txt               # List of RSS/Atom URLs (1 per line)
├── main.py                 # Script to fetch raw feed data from sources
├── clean_feeds.py          # Cleans and normalizes raw data
├── final_feeds.json        # Cleaned and deduplicated JSON output
├── feeds.csv               # Final CSV version for dashboard integration
├── export_to_csv.py        # Converts JSON to structured CSV
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install the required library:

```bash
pip install feedparser
```

### 2. Run the Fetch Script

```bash
python main.py
```

This will fetch and store raw RSS/Atom feed data into `output.json`.

### 3. Clean and Deduplicate

```bash
python clean_feeds.py
```

This will:
- Clean entries (remove whitespace, check for missing fields)
- Remove duplicates based on feed links
- Save to `final_feeds.json`

### 4. Export to CSV (for dashboards, ML, etc.)

```bash
python export_to_csv.py
```

This will generate `feeds.csv` — a structured, readable dataset.

## 🧠 Next Modules (In Progress)

- **IOC Extractor:** Extract IPs, URLs, and hashes using regex/HTML parsers
- **LLM Summarizer:** Use local LLMs (via Ollama) to generate summaries
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize feeds and IOCs using Gradio
